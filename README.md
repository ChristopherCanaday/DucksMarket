Duck’s Market is a website created for the company of the same name that sells a wide variety of items. The company has never had any big form of advertising before. We tried to keep uniformity as much as possible to keep the design user friendly.

The website consists of 8 pages: Home, Fireworks, Concrete Statuary, Rugs, Fiesta China, Mexican Clay, About Us, and Contact Us.

# Home:
This page was the first created. The page started out as a white background with the words Duck’s Market. We eventually figured out how to center the words vertically and horizontally. We set the background of the words to blue which helped show what space the div took up. We then decided to make a navigation bar to allow the user to navigate around the site. Then we decided to add a background image. We chose the background image from their Facebook page and put it in the background. We added the lines above and below the words. Afterwards, we changed the words to orange as the owner prefered it that way, and to make it stand out more.

# About Us:
We created this page to show the history of the company. We took the same layout from the other pages and transferred it to this one. We then changed the information and added a picture of what the company used to look like. 

# Contact Us:
We created this page to allow people to contact the business. It includes their email, address, phone number, and Facebook page. It is modeled after the other pages.

# Fireworks:
We first transferred the navigation bar over from the Home page. We created a div and put the information into it. We made the div have a background of gray to keep uniformity with the gray navigation bar. Then we added the background image from the home page to keep uniformity. After that we added pictures from the Facebook page.

# Concrete Statuary, Fiesta China, Rugs, and Mexican Clay:
All of these pages were modeled after the fireworks page. The information on each page was changed to their respective subjects. The images were also changed to their respective subjects.
