# Team Darby- Ben Arnold, Leighanne Dugger, and Christopher Canaday

Duck’s Market is a local, family owned business in Henderson, Tennessee that mainly sells fireworks and concrete statuary. The company has never had any form of advertising other than Facebook. We tried to keep uniformity as much as possible to keep the design user friendly.

Our team name came from the owner’s dog, Darby, who “works” at the store. She always greets the customers and makes them smile as they walk throughout the store. 

Ben started working for his aunt, the owner of the store, in the summer of 2017. When the DevCatalyst competition came up he thought about Duck’s Market. He presented this idea to the team and the team agreed. We met with the owner later and discussed what she wanted for the website. 

# The website consists of 8 pages: Home, Fireworks, Concrete Statuary, Rugs, Fiesta China, Mexican Clay, About Us, and Contact Us.

## Home:
This page was the first created. The page started out as a white background with the words Duck’s Market. We eventually figured out how to center the words vertically and horizontally. We set the background of the words to blue which helped show what space the div took up. We then decided to make a navigation bar to allow the user to navigate around the site. Then we decided to add a background image. We chose the background image from their Facebook page and added it to the background. We inserted the lines above and below the words. Afterwards, we changed the words to orange as the owner prefered it that way, and to make it stand out more.

## About Us:
We created this page to show the history of the company. The company was started in Scotts Hill, Tennessee during 1949. They started out selling rugs and produce until the company eventually evolved into what it is today. We took the same layout from the other pages and transferred it to this one. We then changed the information and added a picture of what the company used to look like. 

## Contact Us:
We created this page to allow people to contact the business. It includes their email, address, phone number, and Facebook page. For a sense of uniformity, this page is modeled after the other pages.

## Fireworks:
We first transferred the navigation bar over from the Home page. We created a div and added information about the various vendors the company uses as well as providing the history of the biggest provider. We made the div have a background of gray to keep uniformity with the gray navigation bar. Next we added the background image from the home page to keep uniformity. After that we added pictures from the Facebook page.

## Concrete Statuary, Fiesta China, Rugs, and Mexican Clay:
All of these pages were modeled after the fireworks page. The information on each page was changed to their respective subjects. The images were also changed to their respective subjects.

# In Summary:
The owner came to our class to give us her thoughts on what we have accomplished. Throughout this meeting, she provided us constructive criticism on coloring and phrasing, and gave us additional information about the company. As we were working on the website, we learned how to work as a team and provide constructive criticism to accomplish an objective.
